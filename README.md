# Publishing Workflow

## Instructions

1. Create a repository on your GitHub account and create a "gh-pages" branch.
2. Enable GitHub Pages for the repository and set "gh-pages" as its live branch.
3. Clone the repository to your local machine and add an index.html containing HTML boilerplate and an \<h1\> that reads "Hello world".
4. Review changes and push to GitHub.
5. If everything works, use the gh-pages tool to deploy to the live branch.
6. Validate the deployment.
